# New7rowKB

- Privacy-friendly (no data collection, no taps indication).
- Coding-oriented (all the symbols and necessary keys up front).
- Uses `sendKeyEvent()` to mimic physical keyboard as close as possible.
- Suitable for any screen, has floating mode (like Gboard).


## TODO
- Implement simple layout scrolling (use whatever .xml layouts are there).
- Display layout name on the space button (?).
- Enable floating keyboard from notification.
- Enable preferences storage and save KB parameters.
- Enable color picker and font scaling in the app.
- Enable .xml uploading from the storage.
